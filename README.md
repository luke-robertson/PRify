# SUPER PR

Sick of having BIG PR's? Well look no further

## How to use

- Check out the branch on your local terminal, in canva/canva repo
- Run `yarn start`
- - If first time, please enter a canva/canva path e.g `/Users/luke.r/Documents/dev/canva/`
- - It will be stored in `./src/options.ts`

## Results

If you have a branch such as `feature/test-branch-123` and it touches 4 owners files. The results will be :

- feature/test-branch-123-1
- feature/test-branch-123-2
- feature/test-branch-123-3
- feature/test-branch-123-4

These branches are locally committed with the correct files per OWNER file, you should push them remote.
